# CS255-Portfolio

This repository contains key deliverables from my work on the DriverPass project for CS255. The DriverPass project was developed for a client seeking a system to efficiently manage driving lessons and licensing processes. The purpose of the system was to provide a clear way to track drivers, lesson progress, and overall licensing status.

Throughout the project, I focused on gathering accurate business requirements and translating those into a coherent system design that meets the clientâ€™s needs. I believe I was thorough in interpreting the user requirements to deliver a functional and user-centered solution. If I were to revise any part, I would enhance the level of detail in some sections of the system design document to improve clarity and reduce potential confusion.

In designing the system, I paid close attention to how different users, such as instructors and students, would interact with it, ensuring their needs were reflected in the design choices. This user-focused approach is essential for creating systems that are both usable and effective. Moving forward, I plan to apply structured methods such as detailed requirements gathering, system modeling, and continuous user feedback to develop robust software solutions.
